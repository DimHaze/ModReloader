Known bugs:
1. Keep Game Running: Rain particles do not update. Also when in Settings or Config menu, game does not update.

Description of how reload works:
1. RefreshButton calls WorldGen.JustQuit() or WorldGen.SaveAndQuit()
2. RefreshButton sets Main.menuMode = 10001 (ModSourcesID)
3. RefreshButton gets your mod [UIModSourceItem] and calls "BuildAndReload" via reflection. 

// 4-6: Singleplayer.
4. AutoloadSingleplayerSystem uses reflection to hook into "OnSuccessfulLoad". This hook is called when all mods have been reloaded. 
5. AutoloadSingleplayerSystem finds and selects the first player-world compatible pair.
6. AutoloadSingleplayerSystem calls WorldGen.playWorld() to start playing on the world.

// 4-6: Multiplayer.
TODO: Exit any running server / terminal instance. Wait until its finished.
4. AutoloadMultiplayerSystem calls Process.Start("...\Steamapps\...start-tModLoaderServer.bat") with -nosteam -world "WorldX"
5. AutoloadMultiplayerSystem finds and selects the first player-world compatible pair.
6.
