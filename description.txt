This mod introduces some new functionality that makes modding faster, more efficient, and simpler.

For example, when you are building your mod, are you tired of having to exit the world, navigate menus, reload mods and then select a player and world? This is simplified to a reload button in-game which does all this for *faster refresh*!

List of functionality that exists right now:

1. God Mode (toggle with H)
2. Spawn Boss On Top (will always spawn every boss on top of your position, instead of outside the screen)

List of functionality that I plan to implement in the future:

1. Autoload Singleplayer and multiplayer
2. Fast reload (one click)
3. Item browser
4. NPC browser
5. Light hack
6. Teleport anywhere on map
7. Copy structures
